The second day of our Denmark bicycle trip, June 19, started out in despair. It was raining nonstop, and we were trapped in the tent for hours, waiting to get out and start cycling. Our original plan was to get up early and swim in the lake and then continue on our way to Stubbek√∏bing. Because things did not go as planned, we were only able to leave at 1 p.m.

We cycled through beautiful poppy fields.

It has started to rain again by the time we arrive at the Ulslev strand. We pitched our tents near the beach to wait until the rain stopped.
There, we saw a camper approaching us. Later, a woman approached our tent to see if we needed anything. She brought us some hot water, coffee, and snacks. Once again we were blown away by Danish hospitality.

The despair was replaced by excitement and happiness as we cycled through a magnificent forest.  We took amazing photos along the way.

That night, instead of wild camping, we decided to stay in a proper camping area with facilities.
