The second day of our Denmark bicycle trip, June 19 started out in despair. It was raining nonstop, and we were trapped in the tent for hours, waiting to get out and start cycling. Actually we were planning to wake up early and swim in the lake then continue on our way to Stubbekøbing. We could only leave 1 pm. 

One of the view we started to cycling made us forget all the storm and trouble.

When we arrive to the Ulslev strand, it has started to rain again. We tented next to the beach.

This is just one of the scenic views we saw that day. On the way to Stubbekøbing, close to the Ulslev strand. Wonderful reflection.

There we have seen a camper was coming near to us. Later a woman came to our tent and asked whether we need anything. She offered us some hot water, coffee, and snacks. We again were hugged by Danish hospitality. The despair gave place to excitement and happiness as the forest we cycled on was amazing. We took amazing photos along the way.

That night we have decided to stay a proper camping place with facilities instead of wild camping.  Our camping place was next to the sea, near Stubbekobing city center.
