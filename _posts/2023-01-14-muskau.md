We have visited the transnational Geopark “Muskauer Faltenbogen’ (Łuk Mużakowa). There we have explored a post-mining area of the former lignite mine ‘Babina’, where lignite and ceramic clays were mine from 1921 to 1973. 

The post-mining lakes delight with unusual colours of highly acidic water, which contain compounds of many elements - mainly iron, calcium and sulphur, as well as iron bacteria.

The ferry was enormous, with a restaurant and a duty-free shop. We entered in order based on the type of vehicle: trucks first, followed by cars, tren bikes, etc. Like a parade, it was. I was feeling like a member of the biker gang. The engine noise made it impossible to stay in the garage. But the upper sections were fantastic. We arrived in Gedser, our first town in Denmark, after a one-and-a-half-hour journey.

Except for the flags on both sides of the road, I have no interesting memories of Gedser. That was one of the first of plenty of Danish flags we saw on our trip. I never considered it before, but I believe there is a flag fetish in Denmark. In that regard, it is fairly similar to Turkey, but definitely not to Germany...

We saw beautiful scenery and houses as we drove back to Berlin.
