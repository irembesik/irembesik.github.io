This post will be about our trip to the [Lusatia (Lausitz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusatia) region which is between Germany and Poland.

On our way near [Halbendorf](https://www.halbendorf.de/), we came across a group of people dressed in traditional costumes who stopped our car and asked for a donation. We had no idea what was happening. They gave us something called a 'Passierschein'. Later, I looked into what that was all about and discovered it was a Sorbian tradition known as [Zampern](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zampern). We were fortunate enough to witness it. You can check a [short video clip](https://youtu.be/1JxxJ1hfN_A) about Zampern. Another interesting fact I learned there is that there are different German words for carnival, such as Fastnacht, Fasching, and Karneval. In Saxony, carnival is known as Fasching.


I heard Sorbian for the first time while hiking to Liepnitzsee last summer. A hiker was studying the Sorbian culture and language. She was from Serbia, and I initially thought she was working on Serbian, not Sorbian, until she corrected me and explained Sorbians. Later, I discovered that Spreewald is home to many Sorbians.

Our first stop was Rakotzbrücke, also known as the Devil's Bridge and built in 1860. The name devil comes from its unusual design, which implies that only Satan could have built it. This one-of-a-kind bridge can be found in the Rhododendronpark Kromlau near Gablenz. We went on a 6-kilometer hike and had a picnic there.

We have visited the transnational Geopark “Muskauer Faltenbogen’ (Łuk Mużakowa). There we have explored a post-mining area of the former lignite mine ‘Babina’, where lignite and ceramic clays were mine from 1921 to 1973. 

The post-mining lakes delight with unusual colours of highly acidic water, which contain compounds of many elements - mainly iron, calcium and sulphur, as well as iron bacteria.

The ferry was enormous, with a restaurant and a duty-free shop. We entered in order based on the type of vehicle: trucks first, followed by cars, tren bikes, etc. Like a parade, it was. I was feeling like a member of the biker gang. The engine noise made it impossible to stay in the garage. But the upper sections were fantastic. We arrived in Gedser, our first town in Denmark, after a one-and-a-half-hour journey.

Except for the flags on both sides of the road, I have no interesting memories of Gedser. That was one of the first of plenty of Danish flags we saw on our trip. I never considered it before, but I believe there is a flag fetish in Denmark. In that regard, it is fairly similar to Turkey, but definitely not to Germany...

We saw beautiful scenery and houses as we drove back to Berlin.
