The date is June 18th, Saturday. The day began quite early. We met at 5:30 a.m., but we woke up around 4 a.m. We weren't exactly packing experts at the time. I had no idea how difficult it would be to pack the bike. Our first stop was Rostock. We then traveled to the harbor to board the ferry. We saw gazelles a couple of times along the way, but only once did we come across wild rabbits.

The ferry was enormous, with a restaurant and a duty-free shop. We entered in order based on the type of vehicle: trucks first, followed by cars, tren bikes, etc. Like a parade, it was. I was feeling like a member of the biker gang. The engine noise made it impossible to stay in the garage. But the upper sections were fantastic. We arrived in Gedser, our first town in Denmark, after a one-and-a-half-hour journey.

Except for the flags on both sides of the road, I have no interesting memories of Gedser. That was one of the first of plenty of Danish flags we saw on our trip. I never considered it before, but I believe there is a flag fetish in Denmark. In that regard, it is fairly similar to Turkey, but definitely not to Germany...

We saw beautiful scenery and houses as we cycled to Nykøbing.

To find a place to stay, we used the Shelter app. Our first campsite was in Sundby, and it was taken care by an elderly lady named Birgitt. She had been going there every day for 26 years to see if anyone had come to camp. The weather was perfect when we arrived at our campsite. We did some stretching  after a long day of cycling.  Birgitt recommended us to swim into the lake, so did we. There we ran into some drunk youngsters who were celebrating a bachelor party. They were super friendly and welcoming. All were saluting as they passed by. Føtex compose toilet
