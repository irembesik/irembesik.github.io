The date is June 18th, Saturday. The day began quite early. We met at 5:30 a.m., but we woke up around 4 a.m. We weren't exactly packing experts at the time. I had no idea how difficult it would be to pack the bike. Our first stop was Rostock. We then traveled to the harbor to board the ferry. We saw gazelles a couple of times along the way, but only once did we come across wild rabbits.

The ferry was enormous, with a restaurant and a duty-free shop. We entered in order based on the type of vehicle: trucks first, followed by cars, tren bikes, etc. Like a parade, it was. I was feeling like a member of the biker gang. The engine noise made it impossible to stay in the garage. But the upper sections were fantastic. We arrived in Gedser, our first town in Denmark, after a one-and-a-half-hour journey.
