The date is June 18th, Saturday. The day began quite early. We met at 5:30 a.m., but we woke up around 4 a.m. We weren't exactly packing experts at the time. I had no idea how difficult it would be to pack the bike. Our first stop was Rostock. We then traveled to the harbor to board the ferry. We saw gazelles a couple of times along the way, but only once did we come across wild rabbits.
